####Session 4: Performance Testing with JMeter

This session will help you get started with JMeter (an opensource tool) for performance testing.

Some things we'll cover are:
- Basic components/elements of Jmeter
- Record/Playback
- Editing and parameterizing your scripts
- Assertions
- Reading Test data from CSV files 
- Debugging your scripts
- Monitoring and analysing results
- etc

NOTE: This is more of a "Get started with Jmeter for performance testing" than a "Basics of Performnce Testing". During the session, we will spend more time fiddling hands-on with Jmeter rather than talking about the basics of performance testing (which IMO is covered by the suggested reading material).

####Who will benefit from this session:

- You've always wanted to do some performance testing on your web-based project, but arent quite sure how to get started.

OR

- You have used other tools for performance testing and now want to try out Jmeter.
